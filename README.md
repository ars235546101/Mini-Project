This project is a real-time harmonium accompaniment system that generates harmonium sounds based on a singer's voice. It captures live audio input, detects pitch, and maps it to corresponding harmonium notes using MIDI synthesis. The system ensures minimal latency for seamless synchronization. Key technologies include pyaudio for audio input, aubio for pitch detection, and fluidsynth for harmonium sound generation. The application enables singers to receive instant harmonium backing, making it useful for practice, performances, and music learning. Future enhancements may include multi-instrument support and improved latency optimization.
